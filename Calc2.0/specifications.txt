Part one:

Create a Calculator that can handle basic operations such as ( / * + - )
As the calculator can take in Brackets, the calculator must obey BODMAS (Or BOMDAS or whatever it is)
It needs to be able to accept somewhat complex inputs e.g.
    (20 + 300) / 300 * 10
 

Part Two: Extend this into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Refer to: https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/
    A user should put inputs into the calculator similar to the windows calculator (calc)
    When the user presses = it should perform the calculation in the window.

0,0:00,,UnknownSpeaker,So just start recording. So I'm just going to read out what's on the on my screen. And then we can we can start. Okay. So just note that the interview as I just said is recorded takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes depending on how quickly you complete. There's no right and wrong answers. It's just your preferences and what you feel is the right way of answering the question. Some questions may appear a little strange or awkward there's a reason for that. Don't think about it too much just just to go through. And as I said you know it's just your preferences. If you hear some typing that's me making some general notes. That's all. The first part will be on the iPad. Second part will be on this laptop I'll just turn it around. And then you can do the last bit on this. Generally people I've said it's actually quite fun. So that's good. I just need you to verbally confirm that you've read both The participate participation sheet and the consent form. And that you're happy to to participate to. Brilliant. So just have you used an iPad before? Yeah. Great. So it should be fairly fairly straightforward. Sometimes it jumps straight away. You only go identifiers. See for Charlie one? Yeah yeah. That's it. Yep.
0,1:31,,UnknownSpeaker,Cool cold cases? Can you just the highest
0,1:35,,UnknownSpeaker,just only that you that you hold? So you're the preference the ranking question. The way that works is it's fairly straightforward but it needs a little bit of explanation. One is is number one is like a race. So finish them one that's the best. Finish number 10. You're obviously the worst of the 10. But the idea is your own it's your own thought of status what you attribute as high alert status to any of these professions?
0,2:08,,UnknownSpeaker,I don't tend to agree with that question. Or those two people regardless of what your
0,2:15,,UnknownSpeaker,Yeah that'd be difficult. Just try. Right. Okay. Good. So you already said it's quite a difficult one. Can you just talk me through how you just went about allocating these
0,2:31,,UnknownSpeaker,hours on offense because of the role I'm in within the health service I probably prioritize healthcare roles than some of us. But again as I said before I think regardless of what do you do within society organization of injured people?
0,2:46,,UnknownSpeaker,Yeah. Yeah that's fine. So that looks a little bit strange right? The last question and this question basically need a little bit of context. So here what you do is this fictive kind of
0,3:04,,UnknownSpeaker,set of allocation. So if you look on the screen the first set of seven and one in this case you would contribute seven to healthcare one to social care and it goes across the spectrum. And you you're allowed to choose any of them.
0,3:21,,UnknownSpeaker,Right. Okay. Just the same question. Just different numbers.
0,3:24,,UnknownSpeaker,Just different sets. Yep. So this is the same same question. I've changed the categories ramps with social care first then help. Yeah. Good. So it's the same? Same question. How would you go about sort of allocating your what's your rationale for picking the set you chose?
0,3:44,,UnknownSpeaker,I think because. I mean I believe I don't know I think that sums up the health. Healthcare costs more than social care slightly older thought. But I think obviously the integration health and social care nationally are gonna be more joined up and asset so I think we should be not level close to London each.
0,4:05,,UnknownSpeaker,Yeah that makes sense. Great. So that's the last that was the last question. You could press down and choose telling you thank you for this bit. The second bit you're getting the the this this laptop. So I'll take that from you. And do a bit of Alright so I'll just turn this round. Are you okay sitting there because it's a little bit. Yeah. You can also turn around if you want. Yes. All right. So again same question. Yeah those are different different kinds of some of the interview but this instruction should be fairly straightforward. If you have any questions by all means just let me know. Alright. Yeah well the last
0,4:45,,UnknownSpeaker,two but you're really thinking yeah.
0,4:49,,UnknownSpeaker,And you find that it should give you the option when you're finished to look at
0,4:53,,UnknownSpeaker,your I found it okay but I think it was when the Catalan was cut right to health care embargo and social care. Good bye. Yeah I think I don't know if it's because I subconsciously don't associated with healthcare. I don't know.
0,5:05,,UnknownSpeaker,Yeah possibly. So no it's extremely harmful. So did you Did they give you the option to look at your? Yeah that's good. So that's basically research that I promote every every morning on the Tuesday for people to participate in. It takes about takes about 20 minutes. You have any questions?
0,5:29,,UnknownSpeaker,No it's fine. Thank you. Well
